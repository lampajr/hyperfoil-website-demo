bin/controller.sh Any arguments passed to the scripts will be passed as-is to the java process.
By default io.hyperfoil.deployer is set to ssh which means that the controller will deploy agents over SSH, based on the agents configurion. This requires that the user account running the controller must have public-key SSH authorization set up using key $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa. The user also has to be able to copy files to the directory set in agent definition (by default /tmp/hyperfoil) using SCP - Hyperfoil automatically synchronizes library files in this folder with the currently running instance and then executes the agent.</description></item><item><title>Migrating from wrk/wrk2</title><link>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/migration/wrk/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/migration/wrk/</guid><description>Both Will Glozer&amp;rsquo;s wrk and Gil Tene&amp;rsquo;s wrk2 are great tools but maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve realized that you need more functionalities, need to hit more endpoints in parallel or simply have to scale horizontally to more nodes.

Controller and agents While it is possible to run benchmarks directly from CLI, in its nature Hyperfoil is a distributed tool with leader-follower architecture. Controller has the leader role; this is a Vert.x-based server with REST API. When a benchmark is started controller deploys agents (according to the benchmark definition), pushes the benchmark definition to these agents and orchestrates benchmark phases.</description></item><item><title>HTTP</title><link>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/user-guide/benchmark/http/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/user-guide/benchmark/http/</guid><description>All servers that Hyperfoil should contact must be declared in this section. Before the benchmark starts Hyperfoil agents will open connections to the target servers; if this connection fails the benchmark is terminated immediatelly.
You can either declare single target server (the default one) within this section or more of them:
http: host: http://example.com ... http: - host: http://example.com sharedConnections: 100 - host: http://example.com:8080 sharedConnections: 50 HTTP configuration has these properties:</description></item><item><title>K8s/Openshift deployment</title><link>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/user-guide/installation/k8s/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/user-guide/installation/k8s/</guid><description>A convenient alternative to running Hyperfoil on hosts with SSH access is deploying it in Kubernetes or Openshift environment. The recommended way to install it using an operator in your Openshift console - just go to Operators - OperatorHub and search for &amp;lsquo;hyperfoil&amp;rsquo;, and follow the installation wizard. Alternatively you can deploy the controller manually.
In order to start a Hyperfoil Controller instance in your cluster, create a new namespace hyperfoil: Go to Operators - Installed Operators and open Hyperfoil.</description></item><item><title>Steps and statistics</title><link>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/getting-started/quickstart2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/getting-started/quickstart2/</guid><description>In previous quickstart you created a benchmark that fires only one HTTP request. Our next example is going to hit random URLs at this server with 10 requests per second. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how to generate random data and collect statistics for different URLs.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start a container that will serve the requests:
podman run --rm -p 8080:8083 quay.io/hyperfoil/hyperfoil-examples If you prefer running this in Docker just replace podman with docker. You can explore the handling of requests from this example on GitHub.</description></item><item><title>Swagger UI</title><link>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/restapi/openapi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/restapi/openapi/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Using credentials</title><link>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/howtos/credentials/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/howtos/credentials/</guid><description>Hyperfoil benchmarks can refer to external files. When you use the upload command in CLI the files are automatically attached the the benchmark YAML (relative paths are resolved relative to this file). Later on when editing the file you can choose to re-upload some of these. Once the benchmark is built the files are loaded to the in-memory representation - Hyperfoil won&amp;rsquo;t access these files during runtime. With clustered benchmarks these files don&amp;rsquo;t need to be on the agents either - the controller sends serialized in-memory representation to the agents and that contains everything needed for the actual execution.</description></item><item><title>Complex workflow</title><link>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/getting-started/quickstart3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/getting-started/quickstart3/</guid><description>The previous example was the first &amp;lsquo;real&amp;rsquo; benchmark, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything different from what you could run through wrk, ab, siege or similar tools.
Of course, the results were not suffering from the coordinated omission problem, but Hyperfoil can do more. Let&amp;rsquo;s try a more complex scenario:
name: choose-movie http: host: http://localhost:8080 # Use 80 concurrent HTTP connections to the server. Default is 1, # therefore we couldn&amp;#39;t issue two concurrent requests (as HTTP pipelining # is disabled by default and we use HTTP 1.</description></item><item><title>FAQ</title><link>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/overview/faq/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/overview/faq/</guid><description>Why is Hyperfoil written in Java? People are often concerned about JVM performance or predictability. While nowadays JVM is very good in the sense of throughput, dealing with jitter can be challenging. We are Java engineers, though, and we believe that these issues can be mitigated with a right design. That&amp;rsquo;s why we try to be very careful on the execution hot-path.
We could achieve even better properties with C/C++, but the development effectivity would suffer.</description></item><item><title>Manual k8s/Openshift deployment</title><link>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/user-guide/installation/k8s_manual/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/user-guide/installation/k8s_manual/</guid><description>If you cannot use the operator or if you&amp;rsquo;re running vanilla Kubernetes you can define all the resource manually. You deploy only the controller; each agent is then started, when the run starts, as a pod in the same namespace and stopped when the run completes.
Following steps install Hyperfoil controller in Openshift, assuming that you have all the required priviledges. With vanilla Kubernetes you might have to replace the route with an appropriate ingress.</description></item><item><title>Phases</title><link>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/user-guide/benchmark/phases/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/user-guide/benchmark/phases/</guid><description>You might want to simulate several types of workloads at once: e.g. in an eshop users would come browsing or buying products, and operators would restock the virtual warehouse. Also, driving constant load may not be the best way to run the benchmark: often you want to slowly ramp the load up to let the system adjust (scale up, perform JIT, fill pools) and push the full load only after that.</description></item><item><title>Ansible startup</title><link>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/user-guide/installation/ansible/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/user-guide/installation/ansible/</guid><description>You can fetch release, distribute and start the cluster using Ansible Galaxy scripts; setup, test, shutdown
First, get the scripts:
ansible-galaxy install hyperfoil.hyperfoil_setup,{{ site.last_release.galaxy_version }} ansible-galaxy install hyperfoil.hyperfoil_shutdown,{{ site.last_release.galaxy_version }} ansible-galaxy install hyperfoil.hyperfoil_test,{{ site.last_release.galaxy_version }} Now, edit your hosts file, it could look like this:
[hyperfoil-controller] controller ansible_host=localhost [hyperfoil-agent] agent-1 ansible_host=localhost Note You can add more agents by duplicating the last line with agent-2 etc. Prepare your playbook; here is a short example that starts the controller, uploads and starts simple benchmark (the templating engine replaces the agents in benchmark script based on Ansible hosts) and waits for its completion.</description></item><item><title>Examples</title><link>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/user-guide/examples/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/user-guide/examples/</guid><description>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t checked the Getting started guide we strongly recommend going there first.
Below you&amp;rsquo;ll see commented examples of configuration; contrary to the Getting started guide these don&amp;rsquo;t present scenarios but rather list the various configuration options by example.

In practice you might want to simulate several types of workloads at once: in an eshop users would come browsing or buying products, and operators would restock the virtual warehouse.
Also, driving constant load may not be the best way to run the benchmark: often you want to slowly ramp the load up to let the system adjust (scale up, perform JIT, fill pools) and push the full load only after that.</description></item><item><title>Scenario</title><link>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/user-guide/benchmark/scenario/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/user-guide/benchmark/scenario/</guid><description>Scenario Scenario is a set of sequences. The sequence is a block of sequentially executed steps. Contrary to steps in a sequence the sequences within a scenario do not need to be executed sequentially.
The scenario defines one or more initialSequences that are enabled from the beginning and other sequences that must be enabled by any of the previously executed sequences. To be more precise it is not the sequence that is enabled but a sequence instance as we can run a sequence multiple times in parallel (on different data).</description></item><item><title>Phases - advanced</title><link>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/getting-started/quickstart5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/getting-started/quickstart5/</guid><description>Previous quickstart presented a benchmark with three phases that all started at the same moment (when the benchmark was started) and had the same duration - different phases represented different workflows (types of user). In this example we will adjust the benchmark to scale the load gradually up.
At this point it would be useful to mention the lifecycle of phases; phase is in one of these states:
not started: As the name clearly says, the phase is not yet started.</description></item><item><title>Troubleshooting</title><link>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/user-guide/troubleshooting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/user-guide/troubleshooting/</guid><description>It doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. Can you help me? The first step to identifying any issue is getting a verbose log - setting logging level to TRACE. How exactly you do that depends on the way you deploy Hyperfoil:
If you use CLI and the start-local command, just run it as start-local -l TRACE which sets the default logging level. You&amp;rsquo;ll find the log in /tmp/hyperfoil.local.log by default.
If you run Hyperfoil manually in standalone mode (non-clustered) the agent will run in the same JVM as the controller.</description></item><item><title>Variables</title><link>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/user-guide/benchmark/variables/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/user-guide/benchmark/variables/</guid><description>All but the simplest scenarios will use session variables. Hyperfoil sports steps that generate values into these variables (randomInt, randomItem, &amp;hellip;), processors that write data from other sources to variables (store, array) and many places that read variables and use the values to perform some operations (httpRequest.path ) or alter control flow.
Hyperfoil uses different types of variables (slots in the session) for integer variables and generic objects (commonly strings). When a numeric value is received as a string (e.</description></item><item><title>Running the server</title><link>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/getting-started/quickstart6/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/getting-started/quickstart6/</guid><description>Until now we have always started our benchmarks using an embedded controller in the CLI, using the start-local command. This spawns a server in the CLI JVM. CLI communicates with it using standard REST API, though the server port is randomized and listens on localhost only. All the benchmarks and run results are also stored in /tmp/hyperfoil/ - you can change the directory as an argument to the start-local command. While the embedded controller might be convenient for a quick test or when developing the scenario it&amp;rsquo;s not something that you&amp;rsquo;d use for a full-fledged benchmark.</description></item><item><title>Templates</title><link>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/user-guide/benchmark/templates/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/user-guide/benchmark/templates/</guid><description>It is often useful to keep a single benchmark in version control but change parts of it depending on the infrastructure where it is executed or intended load. Since version 0.18 Hyperfoil supports parametrization of the benchmark through templates.
Inspired by other (more complex) YAML templating systems we decided to use YAML tags to pre-process the YAML. Templating happens even before applying the YAML nodes onto BenchmarkBuilder, therefore it is not possible to do that programmatically or with the serialized form.</description></item><item><title>Clustered mode</title><link>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/getting-started/quickstart7/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/getting-started/quickstart7/</guid><description>Previously we&amp;rsquo;ve learned to start Hyperfoil in standalone server mode, and to do some runs through CLI. In this quickstart we&amp;rsquo;ll see how to run your benchmark distributed to several agent nodes.
Hyperfoil operates as a cluster of Vert.x. When the benchmark is started, it deploys agents on other nodes according to the benchmark configuration - these are Vert.x nodes, too. Together controller and agents form a cluster and communicate over the event bus.</description></item><item><title>Extensions</title><link>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/extensions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/extensions/</guid><description>You have probably already read the Custom steps and handlers quickstart which shows how to create a simple component. It can get more tricky when the component embeds other components, though.
The build of scenario happens in two phases. In first phase the sequences, steps and components call method prepareBuild(). Most often that method uses the default (empty) implementation, but if your component (e.g. custom step) embeds another one (e.g. instance of a Processor) it should call its prepareBuild() method, too.</description></item><item><title>Hooks</title><link>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/user-guide/benchmark/hooks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/user-guide/benchmark/hooks/</guid><description>It might be useful to run certain scripts before and after the run, e.g. starting some infrastructure, preloading database, gathering CPU stats during the test and so on. That&amp;rsquo;s why Hyperfoil introduces pre- and post-hooks to the run.
Some scripts are not specific to the test being run - these should be deployed on controller as files in *root*/hooks/pre/ and *root*/hooks/post directories where root is controller&amp;rsquo;s root directory, /tmp/hyperfoil/ by default.</description></item><item><title>Custom components</title><link>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/getting-started/quickstart8/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/getting-started/quickstart8/</guid><description>Hyperfoil offers some basic steps to do HTTP requests, generate data, alter control flow in the scenario etc., but your needs may surpass the features implemented so far. Also, it might be just easier to express your logic in Java code than combining steps in the YAML. The downside is reduced ability to reuse and more tight dependency on Hyperfoil APIs.

There are still cases where you&amp;rsquo;d like to run in this mode and check the size of the error you&amp;rsquo;re accumulating.
Many benchmarks use closed-model with fixed concurrency and cycle-time, expecting the request to be fired every X milliseconds. When the requests fall behind in schedule due to some requests taking more than this period (cycle-time) the subsequent requests are fired as quickly as possible to catch up.</description></item><item><title>Fetch embedded resources</title><link>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/blog/news/2020-11-16-fetch-embedded/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/blog/news/2020-11-16-fetch-embedded/</guid><description>When browsing a website it&amp;rsquo;s not only the main page the webserver needs to serve - usually there are static resources such as images, stylesheets, scripts and more. Hyperfoil can automatically download these.
Hyperfoil implements a non-allocating HTML parser, with a pre-baked onEmbeddedResource handler: This selects HTML tags with appropriate attributes that represent an URL:
Images: &amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;...&amp;quot;&amp;gt; Stylesheets: &amp;lt;link href=&amp;quot;...&amp;quot;&amp;gt; Scripts: &amp;lt;script src=&amp;quot;...&amp;quot;&amp;gt; Embedded media: &amp;lt;embed src=&amp;quot;...&amp;quot;&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;object data=&amp;quot;...&amp;quot;&amp;gt; Frames: &amp;lt;frame src=&amp;quot;.</description></item><item><title>Automatic follow of redirects</title><link>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/blog/news/2020-11-16-follow-redirect/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/blog/news/2020-11-16-follow-redirect/</guid><description>Hyperfoil is trying to imitate how users will hit your site with requests as realistically as possible. Therefore it supports one of the browser features: redirections.
There are two ways how webservers tell browsers where to fetch another page: HTTP-level redirects where the server returns status 3xx and the new URL in the Location header, and HTML with &amp;lt;meta http-equiv=&amp;quot;refresh&amp;quot; content=&amp;quot;5; url=http://example.com&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;. The webpage can also use Javascript to switch to another page but Hyperfoil is not interpretting any Javascript.</description></item><item><title>addItem</title><link>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/reference/actions/action_additem/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lampajr.github.io/hyperfoil-website-demo/docs/reference/actions/action_additem/</guid><description>Appends value to an array stored in another variable.
