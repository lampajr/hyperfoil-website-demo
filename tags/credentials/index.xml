When you use the upload command in CLI the files are automatically attached the the benchmark YAML (relative paths are resolved relative to this file). Later on when editing the file you can choose to re-upload some of these. Once the benchmark is built the files are loaded to the in-memory representation - Hyperfoil won&amp;rsquo;t access these files during runtime. With clustered benchmarks these files don&amp;rsquo;t need to be on the agents either - the controller sends serialized in-memory representation to the agents and that contains everything needed for the actual execution.</description></item></channel></rss>
